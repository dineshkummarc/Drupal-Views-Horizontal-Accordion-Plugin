################################################

### DESCRIPTION 

Views Horizontal Accordion provides a display style plugin for the Views module.
It will take the results and display them as a jQuery horizontal accordion style. 


### INSTALLATION 

1. Place the views_horz_accordion module in your modules directory (usually under /sites/all/modules/).
2. Go to /admin/build/modules, and activate the module (you will find it under the Views section).


### USING VIEWS HORIZONTAL ACCORDION MODULE 

Your view must meet the following requirements:

  * Row style must be set to Fields
  * The header field can not be set to inline.
  * If you use a separator for inline fields, be sure to wrap it in a html tag
  * Provide at least two fields to show.

Choose Views Accordion in the Style dialog within your view, which will prompt you to configure the display options (please note this currently has no effect).

This is currently a work in progress, and is a 'dev' release, so please be careful when using this on your sites.

### DEVELOPMENT

More development will follow..
